🔍 Key Insights & Business RecommendationsInsights


Footwear is the highest-selling category.
Foot Locker is the most profitable retailer.
Charleston, Miami, New York, Portland and San Francisco are the  5 top-performing cities.
Sales are highest in the West and Northeast regions.
In-store sales dominate over online and outlet.
Sales performance in 2020 remained mostly low, with the exception of a noticeable spike in April and a smaller rise in May. Starting Jan 2021, sales gradually improved, ultimately reaching their highest point in July 2021.
 The initial sales dip in 2020 was largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, which disrupted retail activity. The April and May spikes likely reflect consumer rebound after lockdown easing and government stimulus efforts. As confidence returned and restrictions lifted, mid-2021 saw a surge driven by pent-up demand, seasonal back-to-school shopping, and strategic retail promotions.
 
Recommendations:

Improve online experience for footwear to match in-store performance.
Expand in high-performing cities/regions.
Target apparel campaigns toward female buyers.
Focus marketing efforts during seasonal peaks.
